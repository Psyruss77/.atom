# wlwl2 One Light UI 

**The bug might already be fixed in the official package.**

**I had to create this repo quickly at work because my editor couldn't function 
because of this bug.**

I would like to apologize sincerely that I didn't use VCS properly or recorded
the bug fix (the exact code I changed), but I guess if I have time I can still
diff it. If I had/have time, I could have forked the repo and submitted a pull
request.

I am still using this package though...

Seems alright... :/
