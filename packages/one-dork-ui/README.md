####One Dork Fork of One Dark UI.

The fancy icons shown in the screenshot can be installed either by copying the file-icons directory in this repo to ~/.atom/packages. OR you can directly install the original "file-icons" package in atom, created by Daniel Brooker, who is the real hero behind your newly iconified tabs and tree-view. All I did was change the colors a bit to match my git status colors in this UI theme.

If you dig the syntax theme below go check out [oceans16-atom](https://github.com/dunovank/oceans16-atom) repo!
